## Introduction

Hello everyone! My name is Antonio Walter De Fusco, and I am an undergraduate computer science student at the University of Salerno. I am excited to share my journey, projects, and insights with you through this blog.

## My Journey

I developed a passion for technology and software development early on. My academic journey at the University of Salerno has allowed me to gain a solid foundation in computer science, and I have had the opportunity to work on several exciting projects.

## Key Projects

### Tennis Management System

One of the notable projects I have worked on is the Tennis Management System. This project was designed to streamline the management of tennis clubs, handling player registrations, match scheduling, and result tracking. You can find more details about this project in its [repository](https://github.com/AntonioWalter/tennis-management-system).

### Tree-Time

Currently, I am working on an e-commerce platform called Tree-Time with my university colleagues. This platform allows users to purchase trees that will be planted in endangered areas. The project is expected to be completed by June, and you can follow our progress in the [repository](https://github.com/AntonioWalter/Tree-Time).

## Hackathon Success

I am also proud to share that my team and I secured the second place in the Made in Italy Innovation Challenge, a hackathon organized by Codemotion and the Zecca di Stato. We gained valuable experience in software and hardware technologies for product protection and traceability. You can find more details about our project in the [repository](https://github.com/GrandeVx/verITA).

## Future Aspirations

Looking ahead, I aim to continue improving my skills and contributing to impactful projects. I am particularly interested in exploring new technologies and finding innovative solutions to real-world problems.

Thank you for visiting my blog! Stay tuned for more updates and insights.

Best regards,  
Antonio Walter De Fusco
